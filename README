# Jekyll Remark Story (Story for Remark, on Jekyll)

The great [Story](https://story.xaprb.com/) theme by
[xaprb](https://github.com/xaprb) is a great theme, to enhance the styling of
[Remark](http://remarkjs.com/) slides. However, it is mostly available through
a Hugo theme, so here is a Jekyll version.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo (or your own fork)
1. `$ bundle install` 
1. `$ bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Create a new presentation

1. Create the folder for your presentation: 

    `mkdir <name-of-presentation>`

1. Create and edit an `index.md` file in this new folder:

    `vim <name-of-presentation>/index.md`

1. Fill it with your Remark slide content:
```yaml
    ---
    title: "<name-of-presentation>"
    date: 2021-10-16
    ratio: "16:9"
    layout: story
    ---
    
    # A first slide
    
    With some content
```

4. Look at the example Story presentation for ideas on how to organise and
   style the slides. The live version is
   [here](https://story.xaprb.com/slides/adirondack/), while the source is
   available in this repo (see `./adirondack/index.md`).
